## About Me

I am a results-driven engineer with expertise across the modern tech stack. 

My career has progressed from **Data Engineering** (ETL, pipelines) to **Site Reliability Engineering** (SLOs, automation) and now to **DevOps** (CI/CD, IaC). This journey has given me a deep, end-to-end understanding of building, scaling, and maintaining resilient systems.

My technical foundation includes strong skills in **AWS**, **Linux**, **Python**, **Database Administration (DBA)**, and **PowerShell**.

I am currently finishing my B.S. in Information Technology, combining hands-on keyboard experience with a strong theoretical understanding of data structures, algorithms, and systems design.
